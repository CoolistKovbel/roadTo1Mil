    Hey whats up hello. I hope you have some time to spare. Was wondering if you can help me out with my little challange.

    I am trying to see if I can get 1 dollar from everyone who vists this website. Litterally asking for 1 dollar. Its not much but wanting to see if something like this can work. 

    Those who do send a dollar will be on a mailing list that will send emails when things are getting ready. As well the first 5000 that will make this process go quicker and send 100 dollars will be given NFTs access gratitude + special permission.

    The goal is to raise 1 million dollars.
